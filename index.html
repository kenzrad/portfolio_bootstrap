                        My name is Kensey, though my first name is actually Marion. I'm named
                        after my Nana (my mother's mother), she was a first generation
                        Scottish immigrant (Protestant) who married an Irish immigrant
                        (Catholic). This, at that time, was a major problem for THEIR mums and
                        dads (who disownded them), but it was not a problem for them (the young lovers)! They happily settled in
                        Pennsylvannia, had my mum (among others) who later met my dad (also
                        living in PA). Fast-forward to Germany a few years later, and they had
                        me! Fast-forward 12 years, and we are in Virginia!

                        I have spent most of my life in Virginia. After a northern-virginian
                        adolescense, I moved to Richmond to study Biology and Chemistry at VCU
                        as an undergraduate. After working in academic and industry for a bit,
                        I went back for my Master's at VCU. There, I studied oysters and
                        molecular genomics (two of my favorite things). I have always loved
                        SCIENCE and NATURE, so naturally - I married the two in my graduate
                        research (and through in a flatworm for good measure).

                            During grad school, I got really into rock climbing. In the picutre
                            above, you can see me climbing a boulder-problem in Nevada (Kraft
                            Boulders, Plumber's Crack) a few years back. I also enjoy fly-fishing,
                            stream monitoring (benthic macroinvertebrates, baby!), and playing
                            with my sweet animals: Jelly, Beans, and Hemi.
