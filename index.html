            My name is Kensey, though my first name is actually Marion. I'm
            named after my Nana (my mother's mother), she was a first generation
            Scottish immigrant (Protestant) who married an Irish immigrant
            (Catholic). This, at that time, was a major problem for THEIR mums
            and dads (who disownded them), but it was not a problem for them
            (the young lovers)! They happily settled in Pennsylvannia, had my
            mum (among others) who later met my dad (also living in PA).
            Fast-forward to Germany a few years later, and they had me!
            Fast-forward 12 years, and we are in Virginia!

            I have spent most of my life in Virginia. After a northern-virginian
            adolescense, I moved to Richmond to study Biology and Chemistry at
            VCU as an undergraduate. After working in academic and industry for
            a bit, I went back for my Master's at VCU. There, I studied oysters
            and molecular genomics (two of my favorite things). I have always
            loved SCIENCE and NATURE, so naturally - I married the two in my
            graduate research (and through in a flatworm for good measure).

            During grad school, I got really into rock climbing. In the picutre
            above, you can see me climbing a boulder-problem in Nevada (Kraft
            Boulders, Plumber's Crack) a few years back. I also enjoy
            fly-fishing, stream monitoring (benthic macroinvertebrates, baby!),
            and playing with my sweet animals: Jelly, Beans, and Hemi.
